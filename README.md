# Data Analytics - Amazon Sales Looker

Data visualisation of an Amazon Kaggle report for clothing sales in India created in Google Looker utilising charts, filters, scorecards and Gmaps! The original Looker file allows for interactivity on the data to allow teams to filter as they require. 

Steps as follows:

. Sourced the data from Kaggle
. Loaded into Google BigQuery (due to large file size)
. Cleaned the raw data transforming into enriched data
. Analysed the enriched data in Looker and built the dashboard

Original csv file was too large to upload onto Github, link to Kaggle report attached.
